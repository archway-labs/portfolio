On one end was a ladder, which I had climbed to reach this spot, and on the other was a sort of gallows. Overhanging from the lip, a yet-untied noose hung, a loose rope dangling twenty-five feet down. My ears were full of hot water, the sun took on a filmic bokeh. A sudden shout shattered the moment and I leapt three feet off the pillar, then my hands established communications with the hanging antenna wire. A moment later, loam and pine needles were my bed, they welcomed me home.\n\ni know that love\nis cinnamon and turmeric\n\ni know its slow\nlike mucin or conifer sap\n\ni know it storms\nand it only calms down after\n\ni know that light is languid\nthere’s no dark pressure rising.\n\ni know\ni know\n"
